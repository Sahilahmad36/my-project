     <div className="col-12 text-justify">
     
     A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily 
     interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology and programming 
     to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. 
     Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, 
     click on or otherwise use is the work of a front end developer.

     Front End Development: Commonly Used Programming Languages:
     </h2>
     <div className="col-12 text-justify">
      
      Most front end developers spend a great deal of their time working in HTML, 
      CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap making proficiency in each key to their success.
      <h2 >How Developers Use Each Programming Language:</h2>
      Front end developers use HTML to lay out a document’s general structure and content, 
      CSS for styling and JavaScript for situations that require advanced interactivity. 
      Additionally, they might use AJAX (a combination of JavaScript and XML) to update 
      specific areas of a website without having to refresh the entire page.
      <h2>Libraries and Frameworks:</h2>
      Front end developers also commonly use the libraries built on these programming 
      languages like AngularJS, jQuery and React; and design frameworks including 
      Foundation and Bootstrap. CSS extensions, such as SASS, provide improved modularity and power.
      <h2>Additional Front End Development Languages:</h2>
      While they are less common, front end developers may also use Python, 
      Ruby or PHP to easily connect data with the back end of their website.
